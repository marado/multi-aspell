# multi-aspell

This is an helper script that shows you a list of (pre-defined) language
options to run [aspell](http://aspell.net/) with.

It was written with the purpose of replacing the aspell invocation from
[alpine](http://alpine.x10host.com/alpine/), in order to let you choose which
language you want your e-mail to have its spell checked (useful if you're used
to write mails in more than one language).
